# Build Harness

This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Python projects, Golang projects, Dockerfiles, and more.
It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

**This project is a significant fork of [cloudposse/build-harness](github.com/cloudposse/build-harness). Like it's parent project, it is licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).**

*Example of using the `build-harness` to build a docker image*

## Usage

* **STEP 1**: At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

```makefile
-include $(shell [ -e .build-harness ] || curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://git.io/mintel-build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
```

  This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run-time.

* **STEP 2**: Add `*build-harness*` to your `.gitignore`.

* **STEP 3**: Run `make bh/init` to initialize build-harness.

This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

**NOTE:** the `/` is interchangeable with the `:` in target names

## Examples

### Generic Python Project

```makefile
-include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://git.io/mintel-build-harness"; echo .build-harness)

# Everything beyond this point is optional, unless your CI/CD relies on specific
# generic target names.

.PHONY: init lint fmt test clean

# This target allows you to consolidate all "bootstrapping" into a single step
# rather than waiting for individual targets to do the needful.
init: bh/init
  @$(MAKE) bh/venv pipenv

lint: python/lint

fmt: python/fmt

test: pytest/test

clean: pipenv/clean python/clean bh/clean
```
